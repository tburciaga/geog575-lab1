		<h1>The Growth of a Nation</h1>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		The United States Census Bureau's (USCB) first statistical atlas was produced
		in 1874 to mark the nation's upcoming centennial and to show the 
		progress of the nation over the previous century. The atlas represented
		the country's first use of comparative statistics at a national level and
		provided a means of quickly interpreting complex demographic phenomena
		at a national level.

		<p>USCB produced statistical atlases for the next several 
		decades, but by the turn of the 20th century, interest in producing a
		national atlas had declined, and despite monumental shifts in the nation's 
		population in the following decades, no National Statistical atlas was 
		produced between 1930 and 2000.<sup>1</sup>
		 
		
		<h3>Ranking the Population of Urban Areas</h3>
		The following map uses data compiled by USCB to analyze the growth of cities
		in the coterminous 48 states between 1790 and 2020<sup>2/4</sup>. Instead of representing
		urban populations using total counts, the map normalizes city population
		changes against national population changes by using the relative population 
		rank to track the rise in westward migration.

		<h3>How to Use the Map</h3>
		<h4>Controls</h4>
		The map has several controls that facilitate analysis of the data<sup>3</sup>. In the
		top-left and top-right corners of the map window are controls for zooming
		the map window to examine the data at different scales as well as a layer
		control for switching the basemap and activating the city rank overlay 
		layer. In the bottom-right corner of the map window is the sequence 
		control, which allows for cycling through 230 years of census records 
		to visualize the city ranking data.<br>
		
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		The legend in the bottom-left corner shows a readout of the year being 
		displayed as well as the city rank symbol legend. To view the name and
		rank of a city shown on the map, hover over the city's circle symbol
		to activate a popup. The city will be highlighted in yellow.
